- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeTech93

- 👀 I’m interested in anything DevOps related.

- 🔑 Automation is Key: Currently looking to build more automated solutions using Serverless Framework, Terraform, Circle CI and Azure DevOps Pipelines.

- 🌲 Proficient in writing sysadmin scripts in languages such as Bash, Python, PowerShell.

- ☁️ Progressing further and further into the world of AWS and slowly working towards the professional certificates.

- 🌱 The need to code applications is becoming greater so slowly learning NodeJS, Python and .NET for full stack app development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that involve automation.
- 🔨 Built an application but no idea how to automate the deployment, so all you have to worry about is writing the code? Get in contact with me!
