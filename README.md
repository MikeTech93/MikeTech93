- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeTech93

- 👀 I’m interested in anything DevOps related.

- 🔑 Automation is Key: CI/CD everything, then sit back and relax! CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, AWS CDK & Serverless Framework proficient but looking to expand my skillset using tools such as Terraform and Bicep.

- 🌲 Accomplished in writing sysadmin scripts in languages such as Bash, Python, PowerShell.

- ☁️ Progressing further and further into the world of AWS and slowly working towards the professional certificates.

- 🌱 The need to code applications\backends is becoming greater so dabbling with NodeJS, Python and .NET for full stack app development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that involve automation.

- 🔨 Built an application but no idea how to automate the deployment so all you have to worry about is writing the code? Get in contact with me!
